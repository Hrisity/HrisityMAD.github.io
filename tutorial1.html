        <h2>Tutorial 1</h2>
            <h3>Welcome to your first tutorial!</h3>
            <p>Now, you will learn how to use AI tools to create a website, suitable for your design portfolio, in less than 3 hours. Here’s how to do it.</p>

            <p>Building a design portfolio can be a bit challenging sometimes. You might be just at the beginning of your career path and lack the number of projects to add to your portfolio, or you might be a designer who worked on projects that are “confidential” and you are not allowed to share. Whatever your case is, this tutorial got you covered.</p>

            <p>The first thing you need for your website is a topic. What the website will be about - whether it is an e-commerce website, a business website, a personal website, or an event website. Now that we have many AI tools to assist us, the easiest way to gather ideas for a potential website is to ask a chatbot for assistance. In this tutorial, we are working with ChatGPT. However, you can try working with other similar assistants such as Copilot, HuggingChat, or PopAi.</p>

            <p>Here is a prompt that you can try out. You will notice the variable in [brackets], you can modify them so you get results that better meet your needs.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Prompt: I am a [web designer] who is working on a [portfolio website] where my [best projects will be presented]. However, I need an idea for a [website design that I can work on and add to the portfolio]. Generate a list of [website ideas, as well as what pages could be added, as well as their colour palettes].
            </blockquote>

            <p>ChatGPT: Creating a compelling portfolio website can set you apart in the web design field, showcasing your skills and creativity. Here's a diverse list of website design ideas, including potential pages and color palettes for each. These ideas are designed to demonstrate a range of your abilities, from user interface design to user experience considerations.</p>

                <blockquote>Prompt 2: I will continue with the [Flower Boutique Website]. Now generate the color palette, as well as the content for the website.</blockquote>
                <p>ChatGPT:For your Flower Boutique Website, focusing on a lush and elegant theme with a dark green base, I'll outline a detailed color palette and suggest content for each of the proposed pages. This approach will ensure the site not only looks visually appealing but also communicates the boutique's unique brand and offerings effectively.

               <p>Now, that we have the structure, it is time to ask ChatGPT to create the text content. Here, you will see example prompts that you can use. Try to experiment with these.</p>
               
               <blockquote>Prompt one: For the website option, I selected, generate a list of possible names for this [online flower boutique]. </blockquote>
               <blockquote>Prompt two: For the website option, I selected, generate example text for the “About Us” section.</blockquote>
               <blockquote>Prompt three: For the website option, I selected, generate example names for the flower bouquets.</blockquote>
               
               <p>Then, it is time to generate images for your website. In this tutorial, we are using Midjourney; however, you can use alternatives like DALL-E, ChatGPT v.4, or others.</p>
               <p>Example 1:</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
