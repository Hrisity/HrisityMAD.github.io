    <h2>Capabilities of ChatGPT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Content Generation: The chatbot is perfectly capable of assisting us - designers, in generating creative content for UI elements, such as text for buttons, labels, error messages, text boxes, and tooltips, making the interface more intuitive and user-friendly. You can see how this can be done in the “tutorials” section.</li>
        <li>User Research and Personas: Thanks to its ability to analyse vast amounts of user survey responses; ChatGPT can help us in the building of user personas and understanding user needs better.</li>
        <li>Prototyping and Testing: It can also simulate user conversations. Hence, ChatGPT can play a key role in prototyping chat interfaces or any application where natural language interaction is key. In early testing, this aids user flows and interaction patterns.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: One of the most important features of a good website is its accessibility. Making sure that all users get the same experience is key. What makes ChatGPT a great assistant in making a website accessible is that it can provide suggestions to make the text content we created more accessible and inclusive, and a wider audience will effectively interact with the design.</li>
        <li>Educational Content: ChatGPT can also help with UX/UI design education. For example, you can ask it to generate learning materials, and tutorials, or even provide interactive learning experiences.</li>
