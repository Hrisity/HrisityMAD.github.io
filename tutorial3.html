        <h1>Tutorial 3: Designing with AI</h1>
        <p>It‚Äôs common for us - designers, when working for big organisations to be assigned a project that lacks either text content or images. This lesson aims to help you better handle such situations by providing a detailed tutorial based on a situation I experienced.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Last year, I was assigned to create a website for an online cake shop. Since the shop is to be officially released to the public in a couple of months, I will use a fictional name - ‚ÄúSweet Sensations‚Äù. Initially, his project came with a set of challenges, primarily the absence of some images and text content. Here's how I navigated this project.</p>

        <h2>Assignment Brief</h2>
        <p>The task was clear yet daunting - to design a captivating website for "Sweet Sensations‚Äù without the usual arsenal of custom photography and pre-written content. These were still in the making as well. The goal was to create a digital space that not only represented the brand's identity but also engaged users with its aesthetic appeal and ease of navigation. Their initial thought was that I could use image placeholders and Lorem Ipsum text content. However, I had a better idea.</p>

        <h2>Utilizing AI for Content Creation</h2>
        <p>The challenge of missing content made me turn to AI tools for help. ChatGPT became my bestie for generating text content, from product descriptions to narratives about the brand. It suggested imaginative cake names like "Velvet Symphony" and "Citrus Cloud," which I added to some of the product name placeholders. Surprisingly enough some were so good that the owner of the shop decided to keep them and use them as real cake names.</p>
        <p>I used Midjourney to help me fill the visual gap. I needed images that didn't yet exist, and it produced stunning images of the cakes. All I did was give the Midjourney chatbot a detailed prompt, in this case, a detailed description of the cake. These AI-generated images were so detailed and realistic that they bridged the gap caused by the lack of professional photos.</p>

        <h2>Designing with Framer/Webflow</h2>
        <p>Please, keep in mind that for this step you can use any design tool - code or no code. It really is up to you. After I placed the content on the website, my next focus was on design and development, utilising @framer, in my case. I explored the depth of creativity within the Framer community, where I found inspiration and techniques to enhance my project. With Framer's tools, I created a website that was not just visually appealing but also intuitive, incorporating features like an interactive cake flavour selector.</p>

    <h2>Reflections on the Assignment</h2>
    <p>Overall, I can say that this project truly made me see the potential of AI in overcoming content creation barriers. The whole journey taught me the value of flexibility and innovation - from the concept to the completion of the website.</p>
    <p>I am proud of the outcomes and the teamwork with AI tools. Together we turned this assignment's limitations into strengths.</p>
