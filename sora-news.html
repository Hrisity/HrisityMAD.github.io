    <h1>Introducing SORA by OpenAI: Pioneering the Next Wave of Creative AI</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of this year, 2024, OpenAI announced that their text-to-video generator would be available to the public within a couple of months. This new AI model is capable of creating video content directly from text instructions. Compared to previous video-generating AI tools, Sora is believed to perform way better, as its results are realistic and imaginative scenes. The advancements Open AI made in how AI understands and simulates the physical world in motion are amazing from what we see in the provided examples.</p>

<section class="tutorial-content">
    <p>This innovation aims to train models for solving real-world interaction problems, enhancing creativity for professionals across various fields, including visual arts, design, and filmmaking. With it, we can generate high-quality videos with different lengths. Some of the example videos, I consider better than most stock videos. If you ask why, the answer would be as simple as that - because they would be tailor-made to my needs as a designer. Imagine that you’re working on a website and you need a background video for your hero section. However, in order to find the perfect video, you’ll spend hours browsing on iStock or an equivalent website for the perfect video. With Sora, this will likely take no more than 15 minutes.</p>

<section class="tutorial-content">
    <p>OpenAI’s Sora plays a significant role in advancing text-to-video AI technology, emphasising the importance of feedback and real-world application for its development. I strongly believe that by the end of this year, we will be able to experience this unique technology and generate tons of video content for our future projects. Since there is no demo version, I will provide some of the OpenAI’s examples that I find impressive. You can see all of them by clicking on the link to OpenAI’s Sora from the Resources below.</p>

<section class="tutorial-content">
    <p>Due to weaknesses like struggling with accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene or confusing spatial details of a prompt, OpenAI is postponing the release. Once these are solved, Sora will be officially released.</p>

    <h2>Here are some of the impressive examples. Please, keep in mind that the prompts are developed by OpenAI’s prompt engineers:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prompt: The camera directly faces colorful buildings in Burano Italy. An adorable dalmation looks through a window on a building on the ground floor. Many people are walking and cycling along the canal streets in front of the buildings.

                <div class="image-placeholder" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Prompt: The camera follows behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road surrounded by pine trees on a steep mountain slope, dust kicks up from it’s tires, the sunlight shines on the SUV as it speeds along the dirt road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The dirt road curves gently into the distance, with no other cars or vehicles in sight. The trees on either side of the road are redwoods, with patches of greenery scattered throughout. The car is seen from the rear following the curve with ease, making it seem as if it is on a rugged drive through the rugged terrain. The dirt road itself is surrounded by steep hills and mountains, with a clear blue sky above with wispy clouds.

            </li>
            <li>Prompt: A movie trailer featuring the adventures of the 30 year old space man wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style, shot on 35mm film, vivid colors.
